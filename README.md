# HR Analytics Dashboard – Excel Project

This project showcases an **HR Analytics Dashboard** created in Microsoft Excel. The goal of the dashboard is to provide a clear, interactive view of key HR metrics to support decision-making related to workforce demographics, attrition, performance, and employee engagement.

## 📌 Project Overview

The HR Dashboard was created using a raw dataset that required cleaning, structuring, summarizing, and visualizing.
The final output is an **interactive Excel dashboard** powered by PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers for dynamic filtering.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before building the dashboard, the dataset went through a structured cleaning process:

* Handled **missing values** appropriately
* Standardized and corrected inconsistent fields
* Ensured proper data types for all columns
* Removed duplicates (if any)
* Prepared the dataset for accurate pivot analysis

This ensured a reliable foundation for analysis and visualization.

## 📊 Data Analysis

After cleaning the data, key HR insights were extracted using:

* **PivotTables** for summarizing employee information
* Aggregations based on department, gender, job role, performance rating, attrition, education field, etc.
* Trend and distribution analysis to identify patterns

These summaries were later used to build the dashboard visuals.
